and the provisions of sub-sections (3) to (8) inclusive may be varied or extended by the mortgage-deed, and, as so varied or extended, shall, as far as may be, operate in like manner and with all the like incidents, effects and consequences, as if such variations or extensions were contained in the said sub-sections.		<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(10) Application may be made, without the institution of a suit, to the Court for its opinion, advice or direction on any present question respecting the management or administration of the mortgaged property, other than questions of difficulty or importance not proper in the opinion of the Court for summary disposal. A copy of such application shall be served upon, and the hearing thereof may be attended by, such of the persons interested in the application as the Court may think fit.		<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>The costs of every application under this sub-section shall be in the discretion of the Court.		<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(11) In this section, â€œthe Courtâ€ means the Court which would have jurisdiction in a suit to enforce the mortgage.]
