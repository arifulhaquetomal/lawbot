                    378. Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any moveable property out of the possession of any person without that person's consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>Explanation 1.-A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being moveable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>Explanation 2.-A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>Explanation 3.-A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>Explanation 4.-A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>Explanation 5.-The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>Illustrations	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(a) A cuts down a tree on Z's ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z's possession without Z's consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(d) A being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's consent. A has committed theft.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(g) A finds a ring lying on the high-road, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweler, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweler any debt for which the jeweler might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorized to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives A valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.

<p>(a) A holds Z down, and fraudulently takes Z&#39;s money and jewels from Z&#39;s clothes, without Z&#39;s consent. Here A has committed theft, and, in order to the committing of that theft, has voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to Z. A has therefore committed robbery.</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>(b) A meets Z on the high-road, shows a pistol, and demands Z&#39;s purse, Z, in consequence, surrenders his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z by putting him in fear of instant hurt, and being at the time of committing the extortion in his presence. A has therefore committed robbery.</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>(c) A meets Z and Z&#39;s child on the high-road. A takes the child, and threatens to fling it down a precipice, unless Z deliver his purse. Z, in consequence, delivers his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z, by causing Z to be in fear of instant hurt to the child who is there present. A has therefore committed robbery on Z.</p>

<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="na">&nbsp;</div>

<p>(d) A obtains property from Z by saying-&quot;Your child is in the hands of my gang, and will be put to death unless you send us ten thousand taka&rdquo;. This is extortion, and punishable as such: but it is not robbery, unless Z is put in fear of the instant death of his child.</p>

A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. 		<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z's implied consent to take the 		<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>book for the purpose of reading it, A has not committed theft.

He is guilty of an offence under this section.		<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(c) A finds a cheque payable to bearer. He can form no conjecture as to the person who has lost the cheque. But the name of the person, who has drawn the cheque, appears. A knows that this person can direct him to the person on whose favour the cheque was drawn. A appropriates the cheque without attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an offence under this section.		<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(d) A sees Z drop his purse with money in it. A picks up the purse with the intention of restoring it to Z, but afterwards appropriates it to his own use.

A, in order to defraud B, adds a cipher to the 10,000 and makes the sum 1,00,000, intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(b) A, without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand taka. A commits forgery.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand taka for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand taka. B commits forgery.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B's authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(f) Z's will contains these words- "I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C." A dishonestly scratches out B's name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words "pay to Z or his order" and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words "pay to Z or his order" and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(k) A without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's name certifying to A's character, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>Explanation 1.-A man's signature of his own name may amount to forgery.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>Illustrations	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(b) A writes the word "accepted" on a piece of paper and signs it with Z's name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable, Here A has committed forgery.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>	Explanation 2.- The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery.	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>Illustration	<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>	A draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it.
